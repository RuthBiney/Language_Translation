Overview
This project aims to develop an English-to-Twi translation model using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. The goal is to create an efficient model capable of translating sentences from English to the Twi language, which is widely spoken in Ghana.

Dataset Creation and Preprocessing Steps
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of pairs of English sentences and their corresponding Twi translations. For the purpose of this project, a small sample dataset was created, including basic conversational phrases.

Data Collection
English Sentences: Collected basic conversational phrases commonly used in everyday communication.
Twi Sentences: Provided accurate translations of the collected English sentences.
Data Preprocessing
Tokenization:

Utilized Keras' Tokenizer to convert text sentences into sequences of integers. Each unique word was assigned an integer index.
English and Twi sentences were tokenized separately.
Padding:

Used pad_sequences from Keras to ensure all input and output sequences have uniform lengths. This step is crucial for training the model as it requires fixed-size inputs.
Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using train_test_split from sklearn.
Model Architecture and Design Choices
Model Architecture
The model was constructed using Keras, following a Sequential architecture:

Embedding Layer:

This layer transforms the input integer sequences into dense vectors of fixed size. The embedding size is set to 64 dimensions, and the vocabulary size is limited to the top 10,000 words.
LSTM Layer:

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer with 64 units was added to capture the sequential dependencies in the input data. The return_sequences parameter was set to True to ensure the model outputs sequences suitable for translation.
TimeDistributed Layer:

A TimeDistributed layer was used to apply a Dense layer with a softmax activation function to each time step of the LSTM output, producing class probabilities for each time step in the output sequence.
Design Choices
Loss Function:
The model uses sparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks where class indices are provided instead of one-hot encoded vectors.
Optimizer:
The Adam optimizer was selected for its adaptive learning rate capabilities, improving convergence speed during training.
Training Process and Hyperparameters Used
Training Process
The model was trained using the preprocessed training dataset. A smaller subset of data was used for initial testing to ensure the process works efficiently.
Hyperparameters
Batch Size: Default batch size was used (32).
Epochs: The model was initially trained for 2 epochs during testing, with plans to increase in subsequent training.
Validation Data: Validation set was included to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics and Results
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The primary metric used to evaluate the model’s performance on the validation dataset.
Results
The model's performance was evaluated using the validation set after training. The accuracy achieved during initial testing was monitored to assess potential for improvement.
Insights and Potential Improvements
Insights
The model successfully learned to predict sequences, demonstrating its potential for translation tasks.
Early results showed promise, with correct translations for simple sentence structures.
Potential Improvements
Dataset Expansion: Increasing the dataset size with more diverse and complex sentence pairs would enhance the model’s ability to generalize better to various sentence structures.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and increasing the number of epochs could lead to improved performance.
Attention Mechanism: Implementing attention mechanisms could further enhance translation quality, especially for longer sentences.
Regularization Techniques: Introducing dropout layers could help prevent overfitting during training.

Conclusion
This project serves as an initial step toward developing a robust English-to-Twi translation model using deep learning techniques. With further enhancements and a more extensive dataset, the model has the potential to become a valuable tool for language translation tasks.
